    "> Data is everywhere. Continuously generated and collected across every domain, it is a vast and largely untapped resource of information with the potential to reveal insights about every aspect of our lives and the world we live in. However, the ability to uncover these insights is a highly specialized skill possessed by far too few. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our algorithm involves a parameter, which we'll call $n$. Let me first explain the approach when $n=1$. We will start with an initial character, say \"y\". There are 8 occurences of \"y\" in the input text above (you can count them!). What character typically comes after \"y\"? It turns out (according to the input text above) the next letter is \"w\" the first time and \" \" (space character) all the other 7 times. So we estimate the conditional probability distribution of the next character, given that the current character is \"y\", to be \"w\" with probability 1/8 and \" \" with probability 7/8 (and probability zero for all other characters). To generate the next character, we generate a sample from this simple distribution. Say we pick \" \", so we add a \" \" to our output text and it is now \"y \". Now \" \" is our current character. To generate the next character, we'd need to probability distribution of what comes after \" \" so that we could sample from it. We'd repeat this until the output text reaches a pre-specified length.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about larger $n$? For $n=3$, we pick the next character by looking at the _preceding 3 characters_. We use the name [_n-gram_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) for a sequence of $n$ characters. Our method should work for any $n>0$. For example, take our initial text to be the 3 characters \"is \". There are 3 occurrences of this $n$-gram in the text. In this case, the next letter is \"e\" once and \"a\" twice, so we estimate the conditional distribution to be 1/3 \"e\" and 2/3 \"a\" after \"is \". So we pick randomly from this distribution, and say we pick \"e\". Then our output text is now \"is e\" but our current $n$-gram is just \"s e\" because we're only using $n=3$. So to pick the next character after this, we'd look at what happens after occurrences of \"s e\". And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement this idea efficiently, you will pre-compute the conditional probabilitity distribution for every possible $n$ gram. To do that we need to count, for every possibly $n$-gram, the freqeuncies of the possible next characters, and then normalize them into probability distributions.\n",

    "- `__init__`, a constructor that takes in and stores the value of $n$\n",
    "- `fit`, which calculates and stores the _frequencies_ of all possible next characters given an $n$-gram. These frequencies should be stored in a dict of dicts, where the keys of the outer dict are the $n$-grams and the keys of the inner dict are the possible next characters, and the values of the inner dict are the frequencies (counts). Then, at the end of `fit`, normalize these frequencies into empirical probabilities. Note: before starting the calculations, append the first $n$ characters of your corpus to the end of the corpus, making it \"circular\"; this will avoid a situation where you your `generate` function might get stuck.\n",
    "- `generate`, which creates a random text of a specified length by generating one character at a time from the appropriate (discrete) probability distribution. To perform the random sampling, use the `p` argument of `np.random.choice`. You can start the output text with the first $n$ characters of the input text.\n",
